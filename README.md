A handful of procedures I often find myself writing at the Scheme REPL that I can much more easily load in from this file. Created for use with GNU Guile, but may work with other Scheme implementations, haven't tested. Intended for beginners like myself who may wonder how to flesh out their REPL with useful commands from Python, Matlab etc.
